# WS-1030 Protocol

## Weather Station ws1030 Protocol

Arduino code to read WS-1030 data transmitted over 433mhz frequency

This is a study to capture WS-1030 data trasnmitter over 433mhz frequency

Since I don't have an osciloscope, all protocol was discovered making experiments, delays, and so on

Weather Station manual or manufacturer don't provide protocol

I also included an BM180 sensor for internal temperature and pressure values, this is optional

Sample protocol

```
